# AI-Enhanced Chat Application

This is a Next.js application that integrates various AI models to facilitate dynamic and real-time conversations about generative art and AI concepts. Users can interact with the system through a chat interface, upload files for specific content analysis, and customize interaction settings according to their needs.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose from a variety of pre-defined AI models with unique capabilities tailored to different interaction requirements.
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in real-time dialogue with the AI, receiving responses based on sophisticated machine learning algorithms.
- **Media Handling**: Upload audio or image files, which trigger model switching to accommodate specific media types.
- **Customizable AI Responses**: Adjust AI behavior through settings such as prompt modification, temperature control, and token limitations to shape the conversation.
- **Responsive UI**: Experience a fully responsive user interface that adjusts to different device screens for optimal usability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setup

   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chat.git
   cd chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, execute:

# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you make edits.

## Usage

1. **Select an AI Model**: Utilize the dropdown to select an AI model that fits the type of interaction you desire.
2. **Engage with the AI**: Enter your queries or statements in the chat form and submit them to see the AI's response.
3. **Upload Media**: Upload relevant files for specific discussions or analysis; the system will adapt to handle the media appropriately.

# Deploying a Next.js Application on Vercel

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy a Next.js application using Vercel, a platform that offers the best developer experience for deploying and hosting your Next.js projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Vercel account (create one at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup))
- Your Next.js project ready for deployment
- Git installed on your system (if not, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/))

## Step 1: Prepare Your Next.js Application

Ensure your application runs correctly locally:
1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Test your application by running `npm run dev`. Fix any issues that arise.

## Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository

If your project is not already a Git repository, initialize it with the following commands:
```
bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Step 3: Import Your Project to Vercel

You can deploy your Next.js application to Vercel directly from the command line or by using the Vercel Dashboard.

### Option A: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install the Vercel CLI globally:
   ```
   npm i -g vercel
   ```
2. Login to your Vercel account:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```
3. Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```
   Follow the prompts to deploy your application. Vercel detects that it's a Next.js app and optimizes settings automatically.

### Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2. Click on "New Project".
3. Import your Git repository by selecting it from your connected Git accounts (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
4. Vercel will automatically detect it as a Next.js project and set up everything required. Click "Deploy".

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

If your application requires environment variables:
1. In the Vercel dashboard, select your project.
2. Go to Settings > Environment Variables.
3. Add the necessary environment variables as key-value pairs.

## Step 5: Deploy Your Application

After configuring, Vercel builds and deploys your Next.js application. You can monitor the deployment process in the Vercel dashboard. Once deployed, Vercel provides a URL to view your live application.

## Step 6: Continuous Deployment

Vercel offers continuous deployment:
- Each time you push changes to your production branch (commonly `main`), Vercel automatically deploys the new version.
- You can also configure preview deployments for feature branches.

## Conclusion

Deploying with Vercel not only simplifies the deployment process but also provides scalability and performance optimizations for your Next.js applications. For more detailed information and troubleshooting, visit the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).
